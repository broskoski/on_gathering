        Here is a clip of Speed Levitch describing, how, to be lost in New York City is to be precise about your place in the universe. He then continues to describe how September 11th revealed a vastness of the scale and sky over New York:

        A question that dances across my mind on occasion is best articulated by William H. Whyte in his research project turned book turned documentary, <i>The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</i>:

        <blockquote>
        “If good places are so felicitous, why are there not more of them?” 
        </blockquote>

    This brings to mind the occasional necessity of exploration to find spaces that fit us as much as we fit them. In an article for <i>Art in America</i>, Josie Thaddeus-Johns questions the relationships, historical and contemporary, between panaromas and tourism. She asks:<br>
    
    <blockquote cite="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/virtual-tourism-painted-panoramas-1234582258/">
    “In today’s world of screens, the visual trickery employed by panoramas doesn’t have the allure it once did. What kind of simulacra hold our interest now?”

    Aria Dean, an artist, curator, and longtime Editor at <i>Rhizome</i> until just this year, posits that the digital spaces in which we express ourselves and share with others are entangled in political contradictions as they circulate the imagery of our collective spaces into fragments beyond our intent:

    Perhaps even more linked to the quotidian of our newfound isolation initiated by the pandemic, A.S. Hamrah laments the loss of quietude in social spaces such as at the movies:<br>
    
    <blockquote>
    “Even so, in a movie theater, you were alone with strangers, sharing in the communal act of watching shadows on a screen. There was power in that. Now, merely alone, a blue light shines in your eyes. In the world of streaming, there is no such thing as society.”<br>
    – “Movies” by A.S. Hamrah

Each of these individuals provide examples of the myriad of ways in which public space is shaped, where and how it can be found, and the benefits, dilemmas, and paradigms they present us with. There are clearly both benefits and detriments to these spaces in their iterations over time, which brings to mind a term by the filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha of “speaking nearby”, elaborated upon by Cathy Park Hong in her book <i>Minor Feelings</i>. To quote from the <i>Artforum</i> article in which it was first printed, Minh-ha suggests:

    </div>
    </div>  
    

    <div class="rotate-wrapper">
    <div class="rotate">
    <blockquote>
 “When you decide to speak nearby, rather than speak about, the first thing you need to do is to acknowledge the possible gap between you and those who populate your film: in other words, to leave the space of representation open so that, although you’re very close to your subject, you’re also committed to not speaking on their behalf, in their place, or on top of them. You can only speak nearby, in proximity (whether the other is physically present or absent), which requires that you deliberately suspend meaning, preventing it from merely closing and hence leaving a gap in the formation process. This allows the other person to come in and fill that space as they wish. Such an approach gives reedom to both sides and this may account for it being taken up by filmmakers who recognize in it a strong ethical stance. By not trying to assume a position of authority in relation to the other, you are actually freeing yourself from the endless criteria generated with such an all-knowing claim and its hierarchies in knowledge.”

        Minh-ha’s sentiment is particularly notable because not only does it evoke the idea of physical space, but because it insinuates that it has the capability to be present in every conversation that we have, leaving enough room for whatever needs to be said next.

        Here is a short excerpt that a classmate shared from a documentary titled "The Subconscious Art of Grafitti Removal" narrated by Miranda July and created by Matt McCormick:

        What's intriguing to me about this documentary is the insistence of "subconscious" participation in the creation of public space, by the removal of something adorned on it, creating an entirely new piece of art in the void of where one formerly existed. By any enntities insistence that they are removing grafitti for perhaps hegemonic aeshtetic reasons, they are inadvertently leaving a new public artwork in its wake.

        This past week I joined a thesis group of M.Arch Students at RISD as a visiting critic while they shared their project presentations and research. One student's research focused on public spaces and we entered into a lively discussion of how the are formed. They pointed to this temporary building space, <a href="https://assemblestudio.co.uk/projects/theatre-on-the-fly" target="_blank">Theatre on the Fly</a>, constructed by a theater in England that navigated the architectural boundaries of what's public and private.

        The student argued that the building contained in its design a quality to invite people both inside and out, by way of its large openings and semi-opaque siding that could provide at a glimpse a sense of what might be going on in the space at any given moment. We discussed the ideas of "blended spaces" – something somewhere between inside and out, away from a quite literal architectural binary.

    <div class="rotate-wrapper">
    <div class="rotate">
        I'm curious if there is a digital equivalent to what the student argued as being the benefit of this space – something that invites people both inside and outside, promoting circulation but also giving a sense of "blended spaces" as was discused. Are there "blended spaces" <i>inside</i> of digital spaces? or do they require some measure of physicality as a counter-balance?
