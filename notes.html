    <h1>Notes</h1>

    <!--
        What would you like to gather?
        
        Determine the topic for your crowd-sourced collection.
        Determine your method for aggregating content.
        How many entries would you like?
        Is it for an organization?
        Is it media-specific? (e.g. written quotes, hand-drawn portraits, PDFs, etc)
        Is there a time period?
        Does it fill a void?
    -->

    <h1>P1: Material Gathering</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Idea One: What are our public spaces?</b><br> 
        I will aggregate content compiling a primer on public spaces; their histories, origins, manifestations, constructions, decays, delineations, futures, etcetera. I would like the entries to be primarily texts/PDFs, videos, and imagery, although not necessarily restrictive to those media types. The material would be primarily collected by myself, although open to submissions by anyone. The time period is not limited, meaning anything from the past to current day is acceptable. Ideally, the amount of entries would fall somewhere between 25–75 entries so that it is significant and parseable but not overwhelming. The void it fills is discussing the overalp of physical spaces into online spaces as a unified public commons. In the spirit of the public, the primer would be for no specific organization, but rather for the commons themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Idea Two: Visual Manifestos</b><br> 
        I will aggregate a collection of visually distinct manifestos in art, design, and technology. The method for aggregating content will be both individual and collective, with submissions being mostly unmoderated save for hate speech, harmful rhetoric, etcetera. The material would be primarily PDFs and websites, although any medium would be considered if applicable. Hopefully, there would be sufficient metadata made available for each manifesto, as to what individual(s) drafted and distributed the manifesto, when, how, etcetera. It would not be limited to any time period and hopefully consist of as many entries as possible to represent a broad ideological spectrum.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Idea Three: Liner Notes</b><br> 
        I will collect a visual compendium of album art for music recorded in the 20th and 21st centuries. This collection will be primarily image based, consisting of digital JPGs (or other image types: PNGs, etc.). Submissions will be made available to anyone and it will be unmoderated. It will attempt to fill the void of discussing the role of album art in the current age, outside of the ecosystem of streaming platforms where it is now primarily encountered. It will not be for any specific organization and is intended for any individual or community with a passion for music and visual art. Ideally, entries would be as large as possible and include any relevant metadata such as artist name, album title, year released, artists/designers/art directors involved, etcetera.
    </p>

 <p>
        <b>*Bonus* Idea Four: Community Memory</b><br> 
        I will organize a “reader” on the Community Memory project. This collection will be consist of many types of media: PDFs, images, documents, etcetera. I will aggregate the content based on research and gathering of materials last fall started in Geoff Han’s WFH Resistance workshop. It will attempt to fill the void of discussing what it means for digital spaces to fulfill the role of public spaces and commons like parks, libraries, etcetera. It will not be for any specific organization. Ideally, entries would be as large as possible, but organized successfully to articulate the trajectory of the project and how it relates to contemporary technological and social culture.
