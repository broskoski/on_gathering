    <h1>Collection</h1>

    <!--
        What would you like to gather?
        
        Determine the topic for your crowd-sourced collection.
        Determine your method for aggregating content.
        How many entries would you like?
        Is it for an organization?
        Is it media-specific? (e.g. written quotes, hand-drawn portraits, PDFs, etc)
        Is there a time period?
        Does it fill a void?
    -->

    <h2>P1: Material Gathering</h2>

    <p>
        <b>What are our public spaces?</b><br> 
        I will aggregate content compiling a primer on public spaces; their histories, origins, manifestations, constructions, decays, delineations, futures, etcetera. I would like the entries to be primarily texts/PDFs, videos, and imagery, although not necessarily restrictive to those media types. The material would be primarily collected by myself, although open to submissions by anyone. The time period is not limited, meaning anything from the past to current day is acceptable. Ideally, the amount of entries would fall somewhere between 25–75 entries so that it is significant and parseable but not overwhelming. The void it fills is discussing the overalp of physical spaces into online spaces as a unified public commons. In the spirit of the public, the primer would be for no specific organization, but rather for the commons themselves.

        I've initated this collection by gathering materials relative to public space over the past few weeks on an Are.na channel that I've set up called <a href="https://www.are.na/mike-tully/publicly-spaced">“Publicly Spaced”</a>. Currently there are links to <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10108869">film excerpts</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10107895">documentaries</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10108826">academic research projects</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10107966">lectures</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10377650">quotes</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/10641620">tik toks</a>, and so on.

        Here is a clip of Speed Levitch describing, how, to be lost in New York City is to be precise about your place in the universe. He then continues to describe how September 11th revealed a vastness of the scale and sky over New York:

    A question that dances across my mind on occasion is best articulated by William H. Whyte in his research project turned book turned documentary, <i>The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</i>:

<blockquote>
    If good places are so felicitous, why are there not more of them? 
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    This brings to mind the occasional necessity of exploration to find spaces that fit us as much as we fit them. In an article for <i>Art in America</i>, Josie Thaddeus-Johns questions the relationships, historical and contemporary, between panaromas and tourism. She asks:<br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/virtual-tourism-painted-panoramas-1234582258/">
    “In today’s world of screens, the visual trickery employed by panoramas doesn’t have the allure it once did. What kind of simulacra hold our interest now?”
    </blockquote>

    Aria Dean, an artist, curator, and longtime Editor at Rhizome until just this year, posits that the digital spaces in which we express ourselves and share with others are entangled in political contradictions as they circulate the imagery of our collective spaces:
